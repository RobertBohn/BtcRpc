# Programming with Bitcoin Core

## Introduction
I wanted to take a deep dive into Bitcoin. So I'm working through Christopher Allen's [Learning Bitcoin from the Command Line](https://github.com/ChristopherA/Learning-Bitcoin-from-the-Command-Line) tutorial. At the same time I wanted to learn how to program Bitcoin in Python using Jeff Garzik's [python-bitcoinrpc](https://github.com/jgarzik/python-bitcoinrpc). This project is the resulting examples and note from that process.

## Requirements
This tutorial assumes that you have some minimal background of how to use the command line interface. 

**PART ONE: BITCOIN-CLI**
